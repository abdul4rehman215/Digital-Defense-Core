# 🧪 Lab 15: Container Security Essentials

## 📌 Overview
This lab focuses on **securing containerized workloads** using Docker security best practices and open-source security tools. It demonstrates how modern container environments are hardened against vulnerabilities, runtime attacks, and misconfigurations.

The lab covers **image vulnerability scanning, runtime security enforcement, container isolation, network segmentation, monitoring, and compliance validation**, all of which are critical for DevSecOps, Cloud Security, and SOC roles.

## 🎯 Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Identify container security risks and common vulnerabilities
- Scan Docker images using Trivy
- Analyze vulnerability severity and scan results
- Implement Docker user namespace isolation
- Apply runtime security controls (capabilities, read-only FS)
- Enforce AppArmor profiles for containers
- Apply resource limits and network isolation
- Monitor containers using Falco
- Validate Docker security posture using Docker Bench
- Create a secure Docker baseline configuration

## ✅ Final Outcome
✔ Container images scanned and analyzed  
✔ Insecure images blocked from deployment  
✔ Containers isolated with user namespaces  
✔ Runtime protections enforced  
✔ Network and resource isolation implemented  
✔ Runtime threat detection enabled  
✔ Docker security benchmarks validated  ## 🏁 Conclusion
Container security is a critical component of modern cloud-native environments. This lab demonstrates **defense-in-depth for containers**, combining prevention, detection, and compliance validation techniques used in real-world production systems.

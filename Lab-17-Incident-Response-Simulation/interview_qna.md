# 📘 Interview Q&A – Lab 17: Incident Response Simulation

### Q1. What is incident response in cybersecurity?
Incident response is a structured approach to detecting, containing, analyzing, and recovering from security incidents to minimize impact and damage.

### Q2. Why is baseline data important before responding to an incident?
Baseline data helps identify abnormal behavior by providing a reference of normal system and network activity.

### Q3. What are Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?
IOCs are observable signs of a security breach, such as unusual open ports, suspicious processes, or abnormal network traffic.

### Q4. Why is containment prioritized over eradication in early response stages?
Containment limits damage and prevents spread while preserving evidence for investigation and forensics.

### Q5. How do firewall rules help during incident containment?
Firewall rules block malicious ports, IPs, or traffic patterns to immediately stop attacker communication.

### Q6. What is the purpose of network segmentation during an incident?
Segmentation isolates compromised systems while allowing critical business services to continue operating.

### Q7. Why is evidence preservation critical in incident response?
Preserving evidence ensures accurate analysis, supports legal or compliance requirements, and prevents data tampering.

### Q8. What role does packet capture (tcpdump/pcap) play in investigations?
Packet captures allow analysts to examine network traffic and confirm malicious activity or data exfiltration attempts.

### Q9. Why is professional incident documentation important?
Documentation provides a clear timeline, supports audits and compliance, and helps improve future response processes.

### Q10. What is the final goal of incident response after containment and cleanup?
The goal is full recovery, verification of system security, and implementing lessons learned to prevent future incidents.

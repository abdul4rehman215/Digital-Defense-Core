## 🏁 Conclusion
This lab demonstrated core cryptographic principles using Python:
- AES (symmetric) for fast bulk encryption
- RSA (asymmetric) for secure key exchange and signatures
- Hybrid encryption combining both approaches

These techniques form the foundation of TLS/SSL, PGP, secure messaging, and enterprise encryption systems.

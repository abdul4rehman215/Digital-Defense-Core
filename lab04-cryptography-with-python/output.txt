--- Task 1: AES Symmetric Encryption ---

$ python3 aes_crypto.py

=== AES Encryption Demo ===

[*] Generating random AES key...
Original : This is a secret AES message
Encrypted: b'gAAAAABlZ9F4Zx1vJ6Pp9gHn0lHk9d8ZVnJmGJ5v...'
Decrypted: This is a secret AES message

[*] Testing password-based key derivation...
Password-based encryption successful

[*] Saving and loading AES key...
Decrypted with loaded key: This is a secret AES message

=== Demo Complete ===

Observed behavior:
- AES key generation successful
- Ciphertext unreadable
- Decryption restores original plaintext
- Password-derived key works
- Key save/load functions correctly


--- Task 2: RSA Asymmetric Encryption ---

$ python3 rsa_crypto.py

=== RSA Encryption Demo ===

Original : RSA secret message
Decrypted: RSA secret message
Signature valid: True
Tampered signature valid: False

Keys loaded successfully

=== Demo Complete ===


--- Task 3: Encryption Performance Comparison ---

$ python3 crypto_compare.py

=== Encryption Method Comparison ===

AES Results:
Encryption time: 0.000214s
Decryption time: 0.000162s
Ciphertext size: 6752 bytes

RSA Results:
Encryption time: 0.003841s
Decryption time: 0.005217s
Ciphertext size: 256 bytes

Use Case Recommendations:
- AES: Large data, fast performance
- RSA: Small data, key exchange, signatures
- Hybrid: Real-world secure communication


--- Task 4: Hybrid Encryption ---

$ python3 hybrid_crypto.py

=== Hybrid Encryption Demo ===

Original message length : 3600
Encrypted message length: 4824
Decryption successful  : True

Advantages of Hybrid Encryption:
- RSA secures AES key
- AES encrypts large data efficiently
- Used in TLS/SSL and secure messaging

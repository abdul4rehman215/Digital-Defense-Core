# 🛡️ Digital Defense Core – Hands-on Linux Security Labs

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **hands-on cybersecurity labs** focused on building strong foundational defensive skills on Linux systems.  
All labs were **executed in a cloud-based Linux lab environment** and reconstructed for professional documentation and portfolio use.

The labs emphasize:
- Defense-in-Depth
- Zero Trust principles
- Secure credential handling
- Cryptography & PKI
- Practical automation using Bash and Python

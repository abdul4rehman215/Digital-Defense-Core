- Vulnerability assessment before deployment  
- Controlled patch execution with logging  
- Post-patch service verification  
- Snapshot-based rollback preparedness

- Maintaining secure, up-to-date Linux systems
- Reducing human error through automation
- Integrating vulnerability intelligence into patch decisions
- Producing audit-ready compliance reports

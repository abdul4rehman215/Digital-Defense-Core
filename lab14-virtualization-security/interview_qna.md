# 📘 Interview Q&A – Lab 14: Virtualization Security

Q1. What is virtualization security?
Virtualization security protects hypervisors, virtual machines, and virtual networks from attacks and misconfigurations.

Q2. Why is KVM considered secure?
KVM is kernel-based and leverages Linux security features like SELinux/AppArmor.

Q3. Why are VM snapshots important?
They allow rapid rollback after failures, misconfigurations, or incidents.

Q4. What role does AppArmor play?
It confines VM processes, reducing the impact of VM escape attacks.

Q5. Why automate VM backups?
Automation ensures consistency, recovery readiness, and resilience against data loss.

Q6. What is the purpose of VM hardening scripts?
They automate security configurations like CPU mitigation, network filtering, storage protection, and isolation.

Q7. Why are snapshots important for virtual machine security?
Snapshots allow quick rollback after failures, misconfigurations, or security incidents.

Q8. What security benefit do automated VM backups provide?
They ensure data recovery, business continuity, and protection against data loss or ransomware.

Q9. Why is a separate secure virtual network used for VMs?
It isolates VM traffic, limits exposure, and reduces the risk of lateral movement attacks.

Q10. What real-world roles use virtualization security skills?
Cloud engineers, SOC analysts, DevSecOps engineers, and infrastructure security teams rely on these skills.

# 📘 Interview Q&A – Lab 13: Windows Security Basics

---

### Q1. What is the purpose of Active Directory in a Windows environment?
**A:** Active Directory provides centralized authentication, authorization, and policy management for users, computers, and services across an organization.

---

### Q2. Why was Samba used in this lab for Active Directory simulation?
**A:** Samba allows Linux systems to simulate Windows Active Directory behavior using open-source tools while maintaining the same security concepts and architecture.

---

### Q3. What are Organizational Units (OUs) used for in Active Directory?
**A:** OUs are used to logically group users and systems so that policies, permissions, and administrative control can be applied efficiently.

---

### Q4. Why are Group Policies important for system hardening?
**A:** Group Policies enforce consistent security settings such as password rules, audit policies, and user restrictions across systems.

---

### Q5. What security benefit does enforcing strong password policies provide?
**A:** Strong password policies reduce the risk of brute-force attacks, credential reuse, and unauthorized access.

---

### Q6. How were Windows Firewall concepts implemented in this lab?
**A:** Windows Firewall behavior was simulated using iptables to enforce default-deny, port-based, role-based, and time-based access rules.

---

### Q7. Why is a default-deny firewall policy considered best practice?
**A:** It blocks all traffic by default and allows only explicitly approved services, minimizing the system’s attack surface.

---

### Q8. What is the purpose of time-based firewall rules?
**A:** Time-based rules restrict access to sensitive services such as RDP outside business hours to reduce attack opportunities.

---

### Q9. Why is firewall logging important in security operations?
**A:** Firewall logs provide visibility into blocked and allowed traffic, supporting detection, investigation, and incident response.

---

### Q10. What real-world security skills does this lab demonstrate?
**A:** It demonstrates Active Directory management, Group Policy enforcement, firewall configuration, auditing, and enterprise-level Windows security concepts.
